# Vite SCSS Boilerplate for Codux

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

It includes a single React component to start your project with, a sample [`codux.config.json`](codux.config.json) with preconfigured keys, a `package.json` file to describe the project's packages and dependencies, and a folder and component structure to put everything neatly in its place.

This project includes SCSS support for writing nested rules, style variables, imports, etc.
